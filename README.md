 Task 5: Network Traffic Capture and Protocol Analysis using Wireshark on Kali Linux

Objective

Capture and analyze live network traffic using **Wireshark**, identify protocols, and understand traffic flow at the packet level.

 Environment

* Operating System: Kali Linux (Rolling)
* Tool Used: Wireshark (Pre-installed on most Kali distros)


Steps Performed

1. Launched Wireshark with root privileges
2. Started capture on active network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`)
3. Generated traffic (website visits, pings, etc.)
4. Stopped capture after \~1 minute
5. Applied filters like `tcp`, `http`, `dns` to inspect traffic
6. Saved the session and summarized the findings

Key Learnings

* Practical packet capture and protocol analysis
* Use of filters for efficient traffic inspection
* Understanding of TCP/IP, DNS queries, HTTP requests
